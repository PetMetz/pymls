PyMLS 0.0.0
==========================================================
[ ] Refactor Lattice out of Dislocation (subclass)
[ ] Refactor mandel/voigt reduction schemes out of Stroh class to toolbox (e.g. reduction of Eijmn tensor -> Eij matrix)
[ ] Refactor reduction schemes as an index mapping (i.e. generalize to any input indices)
[ ] Needs to support Miller-Bravais indices for hexagonal systems? (will effect averaging)
[ ] correct failing Stroh class tests
[X] write test suite for geometric quantities
[ ] write test suite for transformations between crystal and dislocation reference frames (possible math errors in MLS paper?
[X] write test suite for MLS interface
[ ] expand test fixtures to remaining crystal classes (trigonal, tetragonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic)
[ ] rewrite tests using testcfg to separate fixture sets and expectations from tests (e.g. testing orthogonality of monoclinic lattice fails, but it should, so it should pass)
[ ] write several examples demonstrating application to known systems
[ ] figure out how to collect tests across multiple modules and execute
